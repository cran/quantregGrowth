Description: Fits non-crossing regression quantiles as a function of linear covariates and multiple smooth terms, including varying coefficients, via B-splines with L1-norm difference penalties.  
    Random intercepts and variable selection are allowed via the lasso penalties.
    The smoothing parameters are estimated as part of the model fitting, see Muggeo and others (2021) <doi:10.1177/1471082X20929802>. Monotonicity and concavity 
    constraints on the fitted curves are allowed, see Muggeo and others (2013) <doi:10.1007/s10651-012-0232-1>, 
    and also <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.12924.85122> or <doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.29306.21445> some code examples.
