===============
version 0.1-2
===============

* argument 'interc' added to cgrq() to include B-splines and the model intercept 
* Some bugs fixed: gcrq() was not working with formulas such as 'gcrq(y~0+x)';
 the component info.smooth was not correctly named in "gcrq" objects causing troubles
with predictQR() (thanks to Oscar Camacho for finding the error)

===============
version 0.1-1
===============

* first public release on CRAN
