===============
version 0.1-3
===============

* Argument 'transf' added to cgrq() and plot.gcrq(). This argument can be useful when modelling bounded oucomes (whereby monotone transformations could be employed). 
* The returned "gcrq" object now also includes 'fitted.values' and 'residuals'.
* gcrq() was not working with values of tau always greater than .5 (or always less then .5); also a single value of tau was not allowed. 
* The objective values for taus < 0.5 returned in the 'rho' components of the fitted "gcrq" object were wrong.
* Some minor graphical arguments added to plot.gcrq() to better control graphical display.


===============
version 0.1-2
===============

* Argument 'interc' added to cgrq() to include B-splines and the model intercept. 
* Some bugs fixed: gcrq() was not working with formulas such as 'gcrq(y~0+x)';
 the component info.smooth was not correctly named in "gcrq" objects causing troubles
with predictQR() (thanks to Oscar Camacho for finding the error)


===============
version 0.1-1
===============

* First public release on CRAN
